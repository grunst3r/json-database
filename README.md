# json-flat
An attempt to create flat-file database around JSON, inspired by CodeIgniter's ActiveRecord implementation.
I have used this for a personal project and it works just fine.

If you like the idea please feel free to contribute to development!
Thank you!

///

Set up your preferred database filename by giving value to $db_file.

Future development:
+ Full CRUD implementation
+ Sorting (order_by etc.)
